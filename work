currently working on:

    fix server side tests (render)
    finish call mark done/undone from client side (use angular's $http)

    when clicking cancel, we get validation msg
    TODO: move all consts to one file
    TODO: move all config values to one file
	TODO: display exercise details (consider a template/Angular directive for all occurrences)
	TODO: separate controllers into different files

functionality needed in the client:

    phase 1:

        drill down (render) - call render of the child
        zoom out (render) - call render of the parent
        mark (as done) (for date)
        un-mark (as done) (for date)
        Add exercise

    phase 2:
        login (http://passportjs.org/guide/authenticate/)
